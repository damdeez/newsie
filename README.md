# Newsie ðŸ“° (just another News app)

Uses the News API (https://newsapi.org/) to bring you the latest News from around the world

## Getting Started ðŸš€

First, create a `.env` file at the root of the project and add in your News API and OpenAI keys
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_NEWS_API_KEY=<API_KEY>
NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY=<API_KEY>
```
Second, install the dependencies and run the development server:

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
# or
yarn i
yarn dev
# or
pnpm i
pnpm dev
# or
bun i
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
